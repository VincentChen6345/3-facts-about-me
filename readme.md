A simple web app that puts into practice my skills on basic DOM Manipulation using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

One problem I encountered was trying to find a way to refactor my button click functions with my button classes. In the end, I gave each button a different class and hardcoded the click function onto each button. I know there must be a way to simplify this however I was unable to find one due to my lack of experience. Do you have any ideas?
